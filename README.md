# Hello-World
Popping the first Commit cherry

Hello People of the Numbers;

You may call me Zer0, nice to meet you all. 
I have started my Number journey at the beginning of last month so I still have a lot to learn.
First time making a Respository and Commit... lets get wild with it!

Wish me luck, better yet I will make my own luck!
